10/7/2014 Resurrected the PHP version at www.laxstats.net and migrated the code for the public pages to version 5.5.3. Surprisingly, most of the news sites that are scraped for content for the home page still exist in roughly their original HTML format from 2007, so things don't look as rough as expected. While the public pages all run, I don't know about the game entry pages yet. Sad that the source code the Playmaker is lost, but glad the app still runs and let's you create plays. 

11/13/2014 Building commenced on the Java version. Using Spring Boot to get it up fast.
