				<h1>Manager's Office</h1>
				
				<p class="">Let's face it, paperwork sucks. It's here in the
					Manager's Office where much of the grunt work happens when it's not
					happening on the field. Like keeping all the paperwork in order,
					entering game data, maintaining team and player information,
					writing letters, emails and notices, blah blah. C'mon, you know you
					hate it: it's a little like taking out the trash, but it has to be
					done. That's where we come in.</p>
					
				<p class="">We've made this work as easy and straightforward as
					we know how, and we've made it so the amount of the data you track
					and the work you do is entirely up to you. So if you're a coach or
					a team manager or just the one keeping the scorebook, it doesn't
					matter whether you're a statistics nut or just a helping hand. Go
					ahead, pop the hood of this baby and poke around inside. Your team
					will be glad you did.</p>
					
				<p class="">Just so no one comes around messing up your stuff,
					we've protected this area so you'll need a username and password to
					get into your private, team-specific office. If you haven't got
					one, get one and get cracking. Your team is waiting!</p>
					
				<p class="">You don't need to be a Laxstats subscriber to visit
					the Manager's Office. Hit the "Register" button and fill out a
					short form to log on. Visit all you want, but remember you won't be
					able to save anything until you join up. When you're ready, click
					the link below for information on how to subscribe.</p>
